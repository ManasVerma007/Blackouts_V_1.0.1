# ESP32 LED Control Project

## Overview

This project involves controlling 8 WS2812 LED strips, each containing 300 LEDs, using an ESP32 TTGO board. The ESP32â€™s RMT (Remote Control) module is utilized to manage the LED strips efficiently. The project demonstrates the ability to handle high frame rates and large datasets with real-time LED control.

## Features

- **LED Control:** Manages 8 WS2812 LED strips with a total of 2400 LEDs.
- **High Frame Rate:** Supports up to 20 frames per second (50 ms per frame).
- **Dual-Core Processing:** Utilizes both cores of the ESP32 for parallel processing.
- **Data Handling:** Reads data from an SD card, decompresses it from zlib format, and processes it for LED control.
- **Circular Buffer Management:** Implements intricate circular buffer management for efficient LED data handling.
- **PSRAM Usage:** Enables PSRAM to handle large frame sizes and prevent memory overflow.

## Components

- **ESP32 TTGO Board**
- **WS2812 LED Strips (8 strips, 300 LEDs each)**
- **SD Card**

## Software

- **xLights:** Used to create LED sequences.
- **ESP-IDF:** The ESP32 development framework used for programming the board.

## Installation

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install ESP-IDF by following the [official guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/).
   - Install any necessary dependencies for ESP32 development.

2. **Prepare the SD Card:**
   - Format the SD card and copy the .fseq file generated by xLights to the SD card.

3. **Upload Code:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Open the project in your ESP-IDF environment.
   - Configure the project settings as needed.
   - Build and upload the code to the ESP32 board using the ESP-IDF tools.

## Usage

1. **Power the ESP32 Board:**
   - Connect the ESP32 TTGO board to a power source suitable for driving the LED strips.

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the ESP32 will begin reading the .fseq file from the SD card.
   - The data will be decompressed and processed in parallel tasks: one core for decompression and the other for driving the LEDs.

3. **Observe the LEDs:**
   - The LEDs will display the sequence as defined in the .fseq file, running at 20 frames per second.

## Code Structure

- **main.c:** Contains the main logic for initializing the ESP32, reading from the SD card, decompressing the data, and controlling the LEDs.
- **led_glow.c:** Handles the LED control and updates the LED strips.
- **extractor.c:** Manages data decompression and buffering.

## Acknowledgments

- **xLights:** For providing the sequence creation software.
